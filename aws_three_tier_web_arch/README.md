# Project: AWS Three Tier Web Architecture

This is a project from the AWS Workshop Studio. The objective of the project is to deploy a three-tier web architecture consisting of external and internal load balancers, a web tier, an app tier and a database tier.

The project is split into seven parts and will give builders hands-on experience with VPCs, subnets, security groups, database deployment, load balancing and autoscaling.

The reference architecture can be seen below;
